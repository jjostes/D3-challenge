## About The Project

This was a quick little assignment meant to familiarize us with using D3.js to visualize data - a scatterplot, in this case. It looks at the relationship between the rate of households that smoke and those that are in poverty.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.
